AJAX (Asynchronus javascript and XML)


AJAX: -It is not a programming language
      -Ajax is a technique for accessing web-server from a webpage
      -Ajax stands for Asynchronus javascript and XML.
      -Ajax allows us to send and recieve data asynchronusly without reloading a webpage
       because of this it's work flow is fast.

*Where it is used.
    -there are too many web applications running on the web so that are on web-server using ajax like gmail,facebook,google,googlemap

*Ajax just uses as combination of  javascript and xml
    -a browser built in XMLHttRequest object(to make request to server for data  from browser).
    -to display data we use javaascript and html DOM

    -with AJAX we can update part of a web application without reloading complete webpage.

    -Step to use AJAX in web-application

        step1- Create object of XMLHttRequest.
                let xmlObj=new XMLHttRequest();

        step2- Write callback method to handle response.
                xmlObj.onload=function(){
                    handle response
                }

        step3- Create a request by using open method.
                xmlObj.open("request","server-url");

        step4- Send a request to server.
                xmlObj..send();
*install json-server
npm install -g json-server

to run json-file on json-server
json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json

JSON data:- when we fetch data from web server it comes in json format
          - in json data is of type text or string.
          -it will look like javascript object .
          -to perform manipulation with json data is not possible so we convert
           json data into javascript object=> JSON.parse();
          - to convert 
    
    *CRUD
         C(create)-post-request
         R(read)- get request
         U(update)- put request
         D(delete)- delete request
