    -latset version of react is 19

*Technology pre-requisit
-html,css,ajavscript(basic,ES5,ES6,oops)

*Software pre-requisit
-node js,npm,text-Editor(vs code)

*there are multiple ways to  create react projecct

1.npx(do not required to install configuration file)
step1: npx create-react-app appName
step2. cd appName
step3. npm start


2.npm(need to install configuration file)
step1: npm install -g create-react-app
step2. create-react-app appName
step3. npm start


3.vite(it will create react project with minimul file)
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react


*App.js: it is root component in react app

node_modules: all dependencies and liabrary will install here.
package.json: all install dependencies and library entry will 
package-lock.json: details desctription of dependencies will be
*In react index.html page will display (render)

*component:
    -it is partial part of react app.
    -component can be reuse multiple time
    -it can be any part of react app
    -In React while creating component its name must start with capital letter
    
    *In react there are two types of component 
    1.function component:
    -when your main foucs is on UI design in that case we use it.
    2.class component:
    -when we need to deal with complex logic and essential data in that case we use it.


    JSX(JAVASCRIPT XML):
    -it makes react code easy and allows us to write html code in react
    -in jsx we have to use one parent element to wrap another element.
    -parent element must be block element like div,p,..

    *props (properties)
    -it allow us to pass data inside component.
    -it return data in object format
    -this is function component we can access props by writing props .propsName
    -this is class component we can access props by writing this.props .propsName
    it is a parameter or functional parameter which is use to pass data inside component


*method and event in react

MethodEventComp.js(cc)     done

***State in class component
- it is use  to handle essential data in class component
- it return object type of data.
- in class component we write state in class constructor.
- we can access state data outside state by writting this.state.propertyName

- we can use state in function component by using  useState Hook.
- StateComp.js cc

*setState(): It is use to manipulate state data.


*Conditional Rendering: display bcomponent output in browser on that basis of Conditional

1.if else:  if condition is true if block will execute otherwise else block
2.elemment as variable: in this we store ressult in variable display it conditionally inside elemment
3.ternary operator: shorthand syntax dfor if else.
 syntax: (condition) ? truepart: falsepart;

4.short-circuit (&&): if the comndition is true then only it execute code.

ConditionalRenComp.js  cc


*Use of CSS in React
1.internal css:
2.external css:
3.module css: -this is use when we have write css property for secific component its filename must  save with filename.module.css

CssComp.js cc

*React/redux snippet for creating component by using shortcut way
-rfce: create normal function component
-rafce: it will generate  arrow function component

-rce: it will generate class component.
-rconst: generate constructor with super method and state.
ChildComp.js fc(function-component)
ParentComp.js

*COmponent interaction , how to pass data from one component to another
*pass state properties as props to child component
*pass metghod as props to child component
*destructering of state
* destructuring  of props


*PureComponent: it prevent unnecessary re-rendering of class component by performing shallow comparison.

-to achieve this we have to extend component with PureComponent class.

@MyPureComponent.js

*React.memo(): it is method which prevent unnecessary re-rendering of function component by performing shalow comparison
- to achieve this we have to pass function component name as an argument to React.memo()method
