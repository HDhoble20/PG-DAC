*App.js : it is root component in react app 

node_modules: all dependencies and library will install here.
package.json: all install dependencies and library entry will be done here.

*component:
-it is partial part of react app.
-component can be re-use multiple time
-it can be any part of react app.
-In React While creating component its name must start with capital letter.

*In react there are two types of component
1.function component:
 -when your main focus is on UI design in that case we use it.
2.class component:
-when we need to deal with complex logic and essestial data in that case we use it.

***JSX(Javascript XML):
-it makes react code easy and allows us to write html code in rect.
-in jsx we have to use one parent element to wrap another element.
-parent element must be block element like div,p.

***props(properties):
-it is parameter or functional parameter which is use to pass data inside component.
-it return data in object formate.
-this is function component we can access props by writting props.propsname 
-this is class component we can access props by writting this.props.propsname 

Task1: create one function component with name MyDetailComp  and pass props fname,lname,contact,email,address and display it.

Task2: create one class component with name FriendDetailComp  and pass props fname,lname,contact,email,address and display it.

*method and event in react 
-onclick,onmouseover 

***State in class component:
-it is use to handle essestial data in class component
-it return object type of data.
-in class component we write state inside class constructor.
-we can access state data outside state by writting this.state.propertyname

-we can use state in function component by using useState Hook.
*setState() method : it is use to manipulate state data.

*conditional Rendering: display component output on browser on that basis of condition.
1.if else: it condition id true if block will execute otherwise else block.

2.element as variable: in this we store result in variable display it conditionaly inside element.

3.ternary operator: shorthand syntax for if else. 
   syntax:    (condition) ? truepart : falsepart;

4.short-circuit(&&): if the condition is true then only it execute code.

*use of css In React 
1.internal css : in starting tag we use style attribute and write css properties in it.
2.external css : in this we creatw a seperate css file and import in component
3.module css : this is use when we have to write css property for specific component . its filename must save with filename.module.css 

CssComp.js  fc
